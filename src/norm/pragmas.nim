## Pragmas to customize `Model <model.html#Model>`_ field representation in generated table schemas.


template pk* {.pragma.}
  ##[ Mark field as primary key.

  ``id`` field is ``pk`` by default.
  ]##

template ro* {.pragma.}
  ##[ Mark field as read-only.

  Read-only fields are ignored in ``insert`` and ``update`` procs unless ``force`` is passed.

  Use for fields that are populated automatically by the DB: ids, timestamps, and so on.

  ``id`` field is ``ro`` by default.
  ]##

template fk*(val: typed) {.pragma.}
  ##[ Mark field as foreign key another type. ``val`` is either a type or a "type.field"
  expression. If a type is provided, its ``id`` field is referenced.
  ]##

template unique* {.pragma.}
  ## Add a ``UNIQUE`` constraint.
